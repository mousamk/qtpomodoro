This is another Pomodoro application written with Qt framework.

Yes, I know, I KNOW that there are already thousand applications implementing Pomodoro technique. But I needed an application to be EXACTLY as I imagine and need it, so I wrote mine too. What's the harm of creating the One thousand and first application?
